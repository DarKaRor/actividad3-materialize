                    To celebrate the 10th anniversary of our hero...

                    his enemy Sonic the Hedgehog, and nearly fights him. Then, Shadow proves himself by defeating the
                    military guard fighter. After Shadow defeats him, he leaves, heading for Space Colony ARK and tells
                    Eggman to bring more Chaos Emeralds and meet him on the ARK.

                        Sonic is always on the move. When faced by his formidable enemy Eggman, Sonic wins every time.

                        boredom and is consistently looking for his next adventure. Sonic lives by his own rules, never
                        thinking twice about what others perceive of him, and driven by his own desires. He was born to
                        run, and he loves to cover as much ground as fast as he can. His demeanor is always cool and
                        calm. When he finds himself in a pinch, he acts as though nothing can stop him. Cool all the
                        way, when faced with a serious situation, he bears down and becomes intensely focused on the
                        challenge.

                        Sharp-witted and willing to do whatever it takes to get what he wants, he always seems to be on

                        Tails is a young fox with a knack for building things. He’s as talented as Eggman but has yet to discover the true potential of what he can accomplish. Sonic has taken Tails under his wing and treats him like a younger brother. Tails wants to prove to Sonic that he’s someone Sonic can count on. Besides his ability to fly using his tails, he has become an experienced pilot of his newly designed plane, the “Tornado”. Tails’ natural talent for building things helps Sonic more than ever this time around.

                        His nickname says it all. He’s a scientist with a body shaped like an egg. With an IQ of 300, he's a certifiable genius, but his childish demeanor makes him believe that taking over the world is easy. Although he seems to think he has a master plan, he’s never quite sure how he’s going to pull it off. Sonic and his friends make fun of Dr.Robotnik by calling him Eggman. In turn, Eggman views Sonic as his archnemesis who always seems to spoil his plans of world conquest. Somewhere deep in his heart, though, he may have a certain fondness for Sonic

                        Knuckles was born on Angel Island and brought into this world to defend the Master Emerald. This is his destiny. If Sonic exemplifies the wind, then Knuckles is the mountain, stern and unmovable. Wild and tough, his determination is unshakable. Knuckles thinks of Sonic as a rival, but is often envious of the adventurous lifestyle he lives and the fame that follows. He is a well-known treasure hunter versed in the martial arts.

Although she looks innocent and carefree, she’s always scheming. Once she makes a decision, her motives are always mercenary in nature.
